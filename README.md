# KVS

`KVS` is a Key-Value Store implementation created as part of the [`Practical Networked Applications in Rust`](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/tree/master/rust) training course.

So far, this repository represents all of the completed work for Part 1 of PNAR.
The project is still very much underway, so updates will be frequent.
